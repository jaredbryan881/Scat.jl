# Scat.jl
This is a Julia implementation of the wavelet scattering transform for 1d signals using Morlet wavelets.
The features of the wavelet scattering transform as a signal representation include translation invariance, stability to time-warping signal deformations, and energy conservation.

This was a final project for 18.337 at MIT in Fall 2020.
